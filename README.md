# Stepwise-connectivity-analysis
Stepwise Connectivity Analysis is a graph-based approach that detects not only direct spatial associations between a seed region and other brain regions, but also multistep associations between the same seed region and the rest of the brain regions through relay stations, thus complementing the conventional connectivity approaches of neuroimaging.
